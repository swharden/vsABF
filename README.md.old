# VSABF

**VSABF is a .NET library which provides simple access to electrophysiology data in Axon Binary Format (ABF) files in Visual Studio.** ABF is a proprietary file format which must* be read using the ABFFIO library, a closed-source DLL which anyone can download (with a few C header files) as part of the "ABF File Support Pack". While the ABFFIO library is free to use, its C-type interfaces require [huge, awkward structs](/src/vsABF/ABFFIOstructs.cs) and fixed-byte values and arrays which aren't trivial to implement in modern languages like C# which dynamically manage memory. ***VSABF provides a simple .NET interface to the ABFFIO library, interacting with ABFFIO.dll so you don't have to!*** 

_*[PyABF](https://github.com/swharden/pyABF) can directly read the binary content of ABF files without using the ABFFIO library_

### PROJECT STATUS: Under Development
* This project is being actively developed as of 2019.
* Future code-breaking API changes are still anticipated.

## Compiled Demos

These demos should work, but their source code probably lags far behind the current vsABF API. They probably also use old versions of [ScottPlot](https://github.com/swharden/ScottPlot) too. You can try-out these compiled demos, but don't spend too much time worrying about their source code.

Compiled demos are in: [/dev/compiled/](/dev/compiled)
